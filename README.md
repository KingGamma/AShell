# AShell
A Minimalistic Shell For Unix Systems

## About AShell
I've created AShell back in 2017 in order to understand by hand the creation process of a process in Unix systems.

AShell currently using the "fork & exec" method, but in the near future (ihopeso) 
i'll implement it with the "clone & exec" (doesnotreallyexists) method.

## Resources
* [Linux Kernel Development](https://g.co/kgs/CfSZbo) - A great book that I'm currently reading.
* [http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/NOTES/process/fork/create.html](http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/NOTES/process/fork/create.html) - A more practical resource.
